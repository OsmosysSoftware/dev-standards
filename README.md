## Scope

This repository currently offers guidance and best practices in two main areas:

- **[Coding Standards](./coding-standards/):** These guidelines ensure that developers follow consistent coding practices and industry standards when writing code. This section provides language-specific recommendations to enhance code quality and maintainability.

- **[CI Setups](./ci-setups/):** Continuous Integration (CI) setups are crucial for automating build, testing, and deployment processes. In this section, you'll find instructions for configuring CI pipelines using various technologies to improve code quality and streamline project development.

While the current scope covers coding standards and CI setups, we plan to expand our documentation to include more areas of development in the future.
