# Log format

## Requirements
To create a common log format that fits the most mobile technologies and aids in debugging:

- Include the severity of the log to understand its importance.
- Include the type of log to segregate between info, error, or warning.
- Include screen or controller where applicable.
- Include a unique ID to trace requests across different components or screens.
- Include source context, which could be a function name, module, or screen name.
- Include relevant data in JSON format, such as user information, activity details, performance metrics, and data changes.
- Facilitate debugging of production issues by providing sufficient information in logs, such as stack traces, error messages, and contextual details.

> **Warning**
> Going against GDPR regulations is a absolute NO

## Proposed solution

``` json
 {"timestamp": "[timestamp]","level": "[level]","severity": "[severity]","tracebackId": "[unique id]","screenName": "[screen or controller name]","source": "[function/module name]","data": [any relevant data of type JSON],"message": "[log message]","stackTrace": "[stackTrace]"}
```

### Explanation of each component: 

| Component     | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [timestamp]   | Represents the timestamp when the log entry was created. Use ISO 8601 format, which is widely recognized and provides a standardized representation of date and time (Mandatory) |
| [level]       | Represents the log level, such as INFO, WARN, ERROR, or FATAL (Mandatory) |
| [severity]    | Represents the severity level associated with the log entry (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) (Mandatory) |
| [tracebackId] | A unique identifier associated with the request (Mandatory) |
| [screenName]  | Name of the screen or controller where the log originated (Optional) |
| [httpMethod]  | Type of request (Optional) |
| [source]      | Function name, Module & Sub module names etc. (Mandatory) |
| [data]        | Any relevant data like user information, activity, performance metrics, data changes etc. (Optional) |
| [message]     | Contains the log message or description of the event (Mandatory) |
| [stackTrace]  | The stack trace of the exception, providing details about the method calls leading to the exception. It includes file names, line numbers, and method names (Optional) |

Here are some examples - 
``` json
{"timestamp": "2024-05-26T10:15:30.123Z", "level": "INFO", "severity": "LOW", "tracebackId": "12345","screenName": "LoginScreen", "httpMethod": "GET", "requestUrl": "/api/example","source": "Authentication","data": {"userId": "123", "deviceInfo": {"platform": "iOS", "version": "14.5"}},"message": "This is an informational log."}
{"timestamp": "2024-05-26T10:15:30.123Z", "level": "INFO", "severity": "LOW", "tracebackId": "12345","screenName": "LoginScreen", "httpMethod": "GET", "requestUrl": "/api/example","source": "Authentication","data": {"userId": "123", "deviceInfo": {"platform": "iOS", "version": "14.5"}},"message": "This is an informational log."}
{"timestamp": "2024-05-26T10:15:30.123Z", "level": "INFO", "severity": "LOW", "tracebackId": "12345","screenName": "LoginScreen", "httpMethod": "GET", "requestUrl": "/api/example","source": "Authentication","data": {"userId": "123", "deviceInfo": {"platform": "iOS", "version": "14.5"}},"message": "This is an informational log."}
```

## Why `ndjson`?
- Easy to read and parse, with each line representing a standalone JSON object.
- Suitable for streaming and processing large amounts of data.
- Suitable for a lot of data structures in the log, especially if we are logging stack trace. 
- Popular format for logs and works well with ELK and Sentry.
