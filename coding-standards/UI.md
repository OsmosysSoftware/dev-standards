| Sno | Element                           | Sub Element              | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1   | Alignment                         | Design                   | While creating components in an app, make sure they align well from a UI perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | Bulk import                       | Import process           | Bulk import (users or anything) should be done asynchronously in the background. We cannot hold the UI / portal / user waiting for a long time while import is happening.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3   | Button                            | Field positioning        | By default - the save / cancel / ok buttons must be on the right side bottom (unless explicitly mentioned)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | Button, Link, Icon                | Design                   | Often, client systems are slow - and some clients are still used to double clicking buttons. Therefore, always put the logic inside the buttons in such a way that, once it is clicked, it does NOT take the second click unless the process is completed. You can incorporate the loading symbol as soon as the first click is made.                                 |
| 5   | Button, Link, Icon                | Interactive              | Providing clear visual cues for interactive elements like buttons and links helps users easily identify and understand their purpose. <br> <br> Example: Provide visual feedback when users hover over or click on a button. This can be achieved through color changes, shadows, or animations.                                                                      |
| 6   | Color                             | Design                   | The color combination should be uniform and neat. Always ask what colors are acceptable. Refer to the project Initiation document for the acceptable colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7   | Data testing                      | Data                     | The best way to test any text field is to go to Wikipedia, pick a paragraph for any item, copy & paste it. Since usually the Wikipedia content has hyperlinks and has a large text, this will allow you to understand if the field is doing the correct validations.                                                                                                 |
| 8   | Data testing                      | Data                     | Even in your testing, use sensible data. Putting XYZ, A1, A2 3fhjfd for names, giving irrelevant addresses do not look good even for internal people. You can maintain one excel with sensible data and use it for the purpose of filling it in                                                                                                                       |
| 9   | Date & Time display               | Show in user's timezone  | Always show times in user's local timezone and you should inform that somewhere to the user that all times you see are in local timezone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10  | Date & Time display               | Format                   | Ensure all date fields are of the SAME Format.<br> This is usually based on the country of the client.<br> And the date storage has to be in UTC and it has to be converted locally based on the local system time                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11  | Date & Time display               | Validation               | Check if previous dates & future dates are allowed in selection.<br> If From & To dates are being selected - the To Date cannot be older than the From Date. <br> Based on the functionality, both the From & To dates may not be into the future                                                                                                                     |
| 12  | Date & Time display               | display                  | Time should be taken from DB and show according to the local time of the system browser is using (That way - UK person sees in UK time while India person sees in India time)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13  | Delete Button                     | Confirmation             | For Every Delete option - ensure you are throwing a POPUP and getting confirmation from the client.. The message should be "You are deleting<< data>>, are you sure?"                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14  | Dialogs                           | Limit the usage          | Use modal dialogs sparingly, reserving them for important or critical interactions. Overuse of modals can disrupt the user's workflow and make the interface feel cumbersome.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15  | Dropdown Field                    | Decision                 | If for a radio button there are more than 3 options then it is always better to use a dropdown instead of radio button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16  | Dropdown Field                    | Sorting                  | Always sort alphabetical unless specified otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17  | Dropdown Field                    | Multiselect              | All multiselect dropdowns should have options to select all or unselect all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18  | Error / warning messages          | Configuration            | All Error / warning / information messages MUST come from a configuration file that can be easily changed without having to make any program changes.<br> <br> Provide clear and meaningful error messages to help users understand and resolve issues.                                                                                                               |
| 19  | Export Data                       | Exporting CSV            | When an export is done with a Grid, only export the data that is shown in the grid for that selected filter options. Export all pages data for that filter option irrespective of the pagination.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20  | Field alignments                  |                          | Following field alignments are important<br> Label alignments - all labels must be left aligned and appear properly under each other<br> All input fields must be aligned properly - same size fields must have left alignment                                                                                                                                        |
| 21  | Field Size                        | Visibility               | If we are giving an email - making the field size only show 10 characters is bad, Similarly - Description / comments / details field must always have multiple lines.<br> If the field content is going to be more than what is visible, then scroll bars must automatically appear. This is more for descriptions, comments, remarks etc                             |
| 22  | Field Size                        | As per standard document | We need a document - that states what are the default sizes for each type of field -- name, email id, Record ID, Date, description, Subject etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23  | Field Size                        | Size                     | For all fields like description, copy a large text from wikipedia and paste it here.. the error should be proper so the user understands the mistake - if the text is beyond limit                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 24  | Fields in Grid                    | Alignment                | All fields (Except Money & Numbers) Preferably aligned Left or center based on the UI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 25  | File upload                       |                          | Never allow .exe or .bin kind of files to be uploaded. Unless the client has given clear instructions - stick to PDF and images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26  | Follow platform design guidelines | Component styling        | If designing for specific platforms (such as iOS or Android), adhere to the platform's design guidelines to ensure consistency and familiarity for users. This includes using platform-specific icons, navigation patterns, and UI components.                                                                                                                        |
| 27  | Fonts                             | Uniformity               | Ensure that all fields in one form and across the application are using uniform fonts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 28  | Fonts                             | Design                   | Have a standardized set of fonts for different elements of a page/application.

# Fields

## Names

Field names or Labels are what helps the user understand which data goes where. Giving the correct & comprehensible labels is very essential for a good user interface. While most of them appear simple & straight forward, maintaining uniformity and correctness is important.  For example, Name & Full Name actually might mean the same thing while explicitly asking for First Name, Middle Name and Last Name makes it extremely clear.

And when a single field has to be used, it is better to use Full Name instead of just Name. Maintaining the same label across all forms is very important. 

Comments, Remarks, Notes are another set of labels are mixed up often and confuse the client. Whatever is chosen shall be maintained same across the application.

One of the common mistakes noticed is to have names appear in camel notation. For ex, ExpectedTime instead of writing Expected time. This is prominently noticed in grids when the data table binding happens. This shall be avoided and names written clearly with appropriate spaces.

## Alignments

Fields are aligned horizontally and vertically.  In addition to alignment, the spacing between fields both horizontally and vertically is important. 

**Label Vertical alignment** – all labels must be either top aligned or center aligned. Osmosys by default uses top alignment.

**Label Horizontal alignment** – all labels must be either left aligned or right aligned. Osmosys by default uses left alignment.

**Label / Field Vertical spacing** - This is the space between two fields in the same column. It is very important to maintain this same across all fields in the page & application.

|                            | Osmosys Default |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Label Vertical Alignment   | Top             |
| Label Horizontal Alignment | Left            |
| Label Font Type            |                 |
| Label Font Size            |                 |
 
## Sizes

Proper field sizes are essential for comfortable data entry and good appearance of the user interface. Following points are to be kept in serious consideration while designing user interfaces:

1. **Relevance:** Proper size for each field is important for a good user experience. An email with 50 characters shall have the field width to accommodate that size. Similarly, the field for Age can have a size that takes 3 characters. If we are  taking notes or comments, then that fields should reflect 
2. **Uniformity:** All fields of the same type in a form / application shall have the same size. This is properly achieved when we follow a well designed CSS. The same proper sizing shall be followed even in grids.

The above image shows three different column widths for the same data type (money) – such  things  shall  be  avoided,  unless explicitly asked by the client.
