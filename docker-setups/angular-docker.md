## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for setting up a Docker environment for an Angular 17 application and to host it on nginx server.

### Scope

- This document covers the basic setup of a Docker environment for an Angular application, including Dockerfile creation, Docker Compose setup, and database configuration.

- Dockerization is done on an app built on Angular version 17.1.0

- This document also covers Dockerization for apps built on Angular version 16 and below.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before setting up the Docker environment, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Docker installed on your local machine.
- An Angular application set up with necessary dependencies.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose.

Download links:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
- [Visual Studio Code (Optional)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 3. Set up for Angular project

In `package.json`, set the command to build the application with production configuration:

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // Other Commands
    // Add the following line under "scripts"
    "build:prod": "ng build --configuration production"
  }
  // ...
}
```

## 4. Setting up the Docker Environment

### 4.1 Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your Angular application.

```Dockerfile
### Stage 0: Build ###
#--------------------------------------
# Use an official Node runtime as a parent image
FROM node:20 AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install Angular CLI Globally
RUN npm install -g @angular/cli

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Angular app for production
RUN npm run build:prod

### Stage 1: Run ###
#--------------------------------------
# Defining nginx image to be used
FROM nginx:latest AS ngi

# Fetch APP_NAME from docker-compose
ARG APP_NAME

# Create App Path for build files for Angular 17 and above projects
# For versions older than 17, replace APP_PATH with /usr/src/app/dist/*
ENV APP_PATH=/usr/src/app/dist/${APP_NAME}/browser

# Copy the built Angular app to the default Nginx public folder
COPY --from=builder $APP_PATH /usr/share/nginx/html/

# Need to make nginx config file
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Set the Correct File Path for Nginx

#### Why?

- When you run the command `ng build`, a `dist` folder is created which contains all angular build files.
- Depending on the CLI version, different folder structures are created.
- We need to give the path of `index.html` for Nginx to work.

#### How to find folder name?

- Folder name is present in `package.json` as `"name": "your-app-name"`
- Verify the folder name by running `ng build` and checking in `dist` folder.

#### 1. For angular version 17

```
build file folder structure

dist
| your-app-name
| | browser
| | | index.html
| | | <...other build files>
| | license
```
**Define APP_NAME in `docker-compose.yml`:**

- Define `${APP_NAME}` in [docker compose file](#42-docker-compose) and skip this section.

**OR ALTERNATIVELY**

**Update `Dockerfile`:**

- Update `ENV APP_PATH` by directly replacing `${APP_NAME}` with your application name like so:
```Dockerfile
ENV APP_PATH=/usr/src/app/dist/your-app-name/browser
```

#### 2. For angular versions 16 and below:

```
Build file folder structure

dist
| your-app-name
| | index.html
| | <...other build files>
```

**Update `Dockerfile`:**

- Remove the line `ARG APP_NAME`
- Set `ENV APP_PATH` as `/usr/src/app/dist/*`:
```Dockerfile
ENV APP_PATH=/usr/src/app/dist/*
```

### 4.2 Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project. Set the arg `APP_NAME` as the name of your application if [not updated in Dockerfile](#1-for-angular-version-17).

```yml
services:
  angular-docker:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        APP_NAME: your-app-name
    image: angular-sample-image
    container_name: angular-sample-container
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:5000:80'

```

### 4.3 nginx.conf

Create a `nginx.conf` file in your root directory folder (where the `package.json` is located) and copy the below code into it.

```plaintext
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### 4.4 Dockerignore

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being copied into the Docker image. This helps in reducing the image size.

```plaintext
.git
.gitignore
.editorconfig
/.vscode/*
/node_modules
/npm-debug.log
/e2e
/docs
*.zip
```

## 5. Testing the Docker Environment

### Build and run using docker-compose file

Run the following command to build and compose your docker image using docker-compose.

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
### OR Alternatively build step by step

#### Build Docker Image

Run the following command in the root directory of your project to build the Docker images. Replace `your-app-name` with a suitable value as an argument:

```shell
docker build --build-arg APP_NAME=your-app-name -t ng-docker-app:v1.0.0 -f ./Dockerfile .
```

#### Create Docker Containers

Start the Docker containers using the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 5000:80 -d ng-docker-app:v1.0.0
```

#### Optional: To get the list of currently running containers

```shell
docker container ls
```

## 8. Conclusion

### Benefits of Docker Setup

Setting up a Docker environment for your Angular application with Nginx offers several benefits:

- Easy deployment and scalability.
- Consistent development environment across different machines.
- Simplified dependency management.

### Future Enhancements

Consider enhancing your Docker setup by adding features such as environment-specific configurations, health checks, and Docker Swarm/Kubernetes integration for production deployments.
