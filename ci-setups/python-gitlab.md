## 1. Introduction
This guide describes setting up a CI pipeline for Python projects at Osmosys using GitLab CI/CD. The setup ensures automated testing and deployment for Python applications.

## 2. Prerequisites
- A Python project hosted on Osmosys's GitLab.
- Basic understanding of Python and GitLab CI/CD concepts.

## 3. Creating the CI Configuration File
Start by creating a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of your Python project. This file will define your CI pipeline.

## 4. Pipeline Configuration

### Defining Stages
Specify different stages like `build`, `test`, and `deploy` in your CI pipeline.

### Python Environment Setup
Use a Docker image with Python installed, or set up Python in the script section.

### Running Tests
Define a job to run your tests, for example, using `pytest` or `unittest`.

## 5. Linting and Code Quality Checks
Include steps to run tools like `flake8` or `pylint` to maintain code quality.

## 6. Example `.gitlab-ci.yml` Configuration
Here's an example configuration for a Python project:
```yaml
stages:
  - test

test:
  image: python:3.8
  stage: test
  script:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - pytest
```

## 7. Best Practices
- Regularly update your CI configuration to reflect changes in the project.
- Maintain good test coverage for reliable CI outcomes.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Check the CI pipeline logs on GitLab for errors.
- Ensure local and CI environments are consistent.

## 9. Conclusion
A well-configured CI pipeline is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of software projects. GitLab CI/CD offers a robust platform for automating Python project workflows.
